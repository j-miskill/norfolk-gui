Welcome to the Norfolk GUI Project!

This small application was built using Django and the Google Maps Javascript API. It draws on Norfolk, Virginia's
open source data on significant trees in the city.

I grew up in Norfolk and I wanted to create something that showed some neat aspects of the city.

Users can:
1. Look at how many neat trees we have
2. Plan a new adventure to find some neat trees
3. Explore the fact that Norfolk, Virginia is a really cool place to be.
4. See a project of a CS student having fun with open source data.


Thanks for looking!
